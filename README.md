# Thrakdrak_Homebrew_pcgen
Repository containing the PCgen homebrew data for the homebrew Thrakdrak campaign setting.

# Quickstart for Windows Users
We assume you have already installed PcGen in it's default location using the installation wizard.
The custom ruleset has to be placed in a specific location in the PCGen folder. Example:
`C:\Users\Tommahs\AppData\Local\PCGen\6.08.00RC8\data\pathfinder\Homebrew\Thrakdrak`

First, go to the pathfinder folder. Supplant <User> with your username and version with the specific version of PCGen you have downloaded:
`C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\PCGen\<Version>\data\pathfinder\Homebrew\Thrakdrak`

Then create the directory Homebrew and open this folder to create the folder Thrakdrak in it.

Download the files from this repository and place them in the newly created Thrakdrak folder.

Now you can open PCgen and add Thrakdrak as a rulesource.
